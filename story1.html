    <h2>Between Glances</h2>
    <p>Character Descriptions</p>
    <p>Lila stands at 5'4", with a curvy, figure-flattering frame that complements her unique style. 
      Her curly, dirty blonde hair often falls in soft waves around her face, adding to her effortless, 
      natural beauty. She has an eye for fashion, combining different styles in a way that's all her 
      own—always chic, but never overdone. While she exudes quiet confidence, Lila is deeply independent, 
      preferring to navigate life on her terms and rarely relying on others for validation. Reserved by nature, 
      she tends to keep her thoughts and emotions to herself, but underneath her calm exterior lies a sharp
      mind and a wealth of intelligence. Lila is not one to seek attention, but her presence is felt by those 
      who take the time to really see her. She's introspective and observant, often thinking several steps 
      ahead and trusting her instincts to guide her through life.

      Oliver stands at 5'8" with a distinctive look that perfectly matches his personality. His ginger hair is 
      thick and fluffy, often styled in a slightly messy, carefree way, and he sports a well-groomed beard and 
      mustache that add to his rugged charm. With clear glasses perched on his nose, his eyes always seem to be 
      scanning the room, taking in everything and everyone around him. Social and outgoing, Oliver is the type 
      of person who can easily spark a conversation with anyone, effortlessly drawing people in with his charisma 
      and humor. However, when it comes to Lila, something shifts. He becomes quieter, more introspective, and it's
      clear that she has an effect on him that he can't ignore. Though he may not speak much around her, his eyes 
      betray him. He finds himself drawn to her, staring at her whenever they cross paths, as if trying to understand 
      the mysterious pull she has on him.
